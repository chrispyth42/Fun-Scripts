# Fun-Scripts
A repo for fun scripts that I've written to perform neat tasks

### galar.py
Reads from the pokemon website 'Serebii.net' to keep tabs on currently known pokemon to be in the upcoming games. Written because I'm still mildly upset that GameFreak announced that not all pokes will be allowed to transfer, or even exist, in pokemon  Sword/Shield :|

### getNews.py
Reads from multiple news outlets' RSS feeds, and places the news stories into a local SQLite database file. With election season coming up, and controversy always surrounding news, I have this script running on a CRON job every 15 minutes to gather data; which may be fun to analyze after a longer period of time
