# Fun-Scripts
A repo for one off, specific purpose scripts that I've written

### galar.py
Reads from the pokemon website 'Serebii.net' to keep tabs on currently known pokemon to be in the upcoming games; using data from 'pkmnGens.csv' to sort them by generation. Written because I'm still mildly upset that GameFreak announced not all pokes will be allowed to transfer, or even exist, in pokemon Sword/Shield. Existence in the Galar dex being the whitelist criteria :| 

### ImgSite/
A fun little webpage with a single button on it, that loads in a random image from a pre-defined array of images; that image being positioned and scaled by CSS so that it's easily viewable on any screen. jQuery is definitely easier for accomplishing this sort of task, but I feel that it would have been a bit overkill to load the whole library in, for a javascript that's only doing 1 thing
