# Fun-Scripts
A repo for fun scripts that I've written to perform neat tasks

It currently contains 
  galar.py:   Reads from the pokemon website 'Serebii.net' to keep tabs on newly released pokemon for the upcoming games
  getNews.py: Reads from multiple news outlets' RSS feeds, and places the news stories into a local SQLite database file
